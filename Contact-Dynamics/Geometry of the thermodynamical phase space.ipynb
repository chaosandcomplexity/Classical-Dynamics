    "# Geometry of the thermodynamical phase space\n",

    "Several areas have been benefited from the use of geometrical tools, gravitation with the Riemannian geometry, classical mechanics with the use of symplectic structures, or the particle physics with the use of convex polytopes in the calculation of scattering amplitudes. It is natural to expect that other areas could be benefited from the use of geometrical methods. In particular, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics enjoy this kind of characterization in terms of a geometrical structure widely know in mathematics, the so-called contact structures. This kind of structure corresponds to an odd dimensional analogous of the symplectic structures, structures well known in physics due to his use in classical mechanics in the study of chatotic behaviour and semiclassical aproximations of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symplectic case is of great interest due to his description of the classical phase space $M$. For example, the classical dynamics described by a Hamiltonian function $H(p,q;t)$ can be understood in terms of integral curves of a vector field $X_H$ (curves that have as tangent vectors the vector field $X_H$) defined by the function $H$ and by the symplectic structure of the space. By studying the geometrical properties of $X_H$ we can arrive to the Hamilton's equations of motion from the components of $X_H$ in the local coordinates $(p,q)$ of the symplectic manifold $M$, undestanding the corresponding integral curves as curves where the function $H(p,q)$ (without time dependence) takes constant values. Finally we can make the statement that a mechanical system is fully characterized by it's Hamiltonian function $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking as reference the classical phase space with it's symplectic formalism is natural to expect that the thermodynamics to benefic from being treated in the same footing. This is possible by using a thermodynamical phase space $(p,q,w)$ equiped with a contact structuture.\n",
